				I'm Emma and I am passionate about building creative, user friendly and
				memorable things for desktop and mobile devices.
			</Typography>
			<Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
				Art and technology has always been a huge part of my life and I've never
				been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it's Paint,
				Photoshop, Illustrator or CSS. Iâ€™ve been designing with computers since
				the day I first opened Microsoft Paint.
			</Typography>

			<Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
				Whilst my love for design began as a teenager where I would design
				'Bebo' themes on photoshop for my friends, I began my coding journey
				later in life. After founding a successful laser cutting and UV printing
				studio which I ran for several years around my three children, I decided
				I wanted a change. I began building websites for small businesses in my
				spare time and found I loved combining my passion for design with coding
				and began taking on online course in full stack development in the
				evenings.
			</Typography>
			<Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
				Hooked on coding, I decided to put all my effort in to learning to code
				and joined a full time bootcamp with Northcoders. Having finished the
				bootcamp in November 2022, I joined GS Systems as a software engineer,
				building full stack mobile and web applications for the hopsitality
				industry, primarily using React and React Native.
